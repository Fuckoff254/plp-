A.Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Here are the core concepts-          
Tracking Changes: The primary function of version control is to keep a detailed history of every modification made to the files under its control. This includes who made the change, when it was made, and what exactly was changed.
Repositories: A repository (or "repo") is the central storage location for all the files being tracked by the version control system, along with their complete history. It typically resides on a server (remote repository) and developers have copies on their local machines (local repositories).
Commits: A commit is a snapshot of all the tracked files in the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and is usually accompanied by a descriptive message explaining the changes made in that commit. Commits form the history of the project.
Why GitHub is a Popular Tool for Managing Versions of Code-
Centralized Remote Repository: GitHub provides a central location in the cloud where teams can store their Git repositories, making it accessible to all authorized collaborators.
User-Friendly Interface: GitHub offers a graphical web interface that makes it easier to visualize the repository, browse code, view commit history, and manage branches and merges, even for those less comfortable with the command line.
Community and Open Source: GitHub hosts a vast number of public open-source projects, fostering a large and active community of developers who can contribute to and learn from each other.
How Version Control Helps in Maintaining Project Integrity-
Preventing Data Loss: By tracking every change, version control acts as a robust backup system. If files are accidentally deleted or corrupted, they can be easily recovered from a previous commit.
Tracking and Understanding Changes: The commit history provides a clear record of who made what changes and why (through commit messages). This makes it easier to understand the evolution of the codebase and to identify the source of bugs or regressions.
Facilitating Collaboration and Preventing Conflicts: When multiple developers work on the same files, version control systems help manage concurrent changes. They provide mechanisms for merging changes and highlighting conflicts, allowing developers to resolve them systematically and prevent overwriting each other's work.
